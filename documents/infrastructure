# AWS services used in the program

##RDS
Our application (udagram ) started by creating a Relational Database Service of postgres type to store the data

And for the database URL:<sub> database-1.cl4wsh40xkhq.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com</sub>

##S3 bucket
Then the frontend application needed Simple  Storage Service for deployment where we uploaded  all the needed files

And for the S3 URL: <sub>http://udagram-project.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/home</sub>

##Elastic Beanstalk
Then for the backend deployment we needed AWS Elastic beanstalk service to upload the build archive to s3 bucket

And for the Elastic Beanstalk URL: <sub>http://udagram-api-dev2222.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/</sub>
